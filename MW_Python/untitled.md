# Percent Increase Bonus Activity

# Formulas
# Increase = Current Price - Original Price
# Percent Increase = Increase / Original x 100

# Create float variable for original_price

original_price = 198.87

# Create float variable for current_price

current_price = 254.32

# Calculate difference between current_price and original_price

increase = current_price - original_price

# Calculate percent_increase

percent_increase = (current_price - original price)/original_price * 100

# Print original_price
print(f"Apple's original stock price was ${original_price}")

# Print current_price
print(f"Apples current stock price is ${current_price}")

# Print percent_increase

print(f"Apple gained ${increase} in stock price. Total percent increase is {percent_increase}.")
