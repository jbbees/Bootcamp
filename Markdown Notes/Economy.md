We see the main character STEPHEN enter the TV CONTROL ROOM. He sees a young woman who works at the station sitting in the corner in disbelief of the events happening. 

STEPHEN (to Woman)
Everything okay?

WOMAN (to Stephen)
I'm still dreaming.


INTERVIWER
You're saying the situation is dire.

SCIENTIST
Not exactly. Um.. your house is burning to the ground the situation is dire. If your house has already burnt to the ground, the situation is over.

INTERVIEWER
Is that the Administration's position or yours?

SCIENTIST
There isn't a position on this anymore than temperature at which water boils. 

Americans are optimistic by nature. 

There's nowhere to evacuate you to.

The room goes silent for a few moments. A panicked-stricken employee rises to address everyone. 

PANICKED TV EMPLOYEE (to all in the room.)
If we stay here. We are going to die here.

TV EMPLOYEE (immediately rises in response. addresses to all, trying to calm the mood of the room.)
Whatever this is. It looks like it's not occuring about 90 miles from here. 

Employees immediatelt begin abandoning the station.

We see a somewhat tidy apartment of PETER. We see PETER'S feet walking. He enters his apartment. We see newspaper clippings of "THE DEAD WALK!" on his wall. And another article "OFFICER PETER SUSPENDED"

EXT POLICE HQ 

We see PETER in casual clothes walking to front of Polcie HQ. Officers are running about to their assignments. 
Peter notices off to the side to see an officer loading large jugs of water and supplies into the trunk of his squad car, likely this cop is fleeing for himself.  

INT POLICE HQ

We see a chaotic police office. Two uniformed officers have a MALE ZOMBIE in handcuffs trying to book him (unsuccessfully) as he tries to bite them and wrangle himself free from the officers, knocking over papers and items from the Desk Sarge's desk. Peter kicks in the main office door and enters. 

CAPTAIN HENDERSON
Hold your fire!

PETER
They're infected.

In a corner a panicking detained man handcuffed to a chair is sitting right next to GAWDY HOOKER ZOMBIE trying eat him, but she too is handcuffed.

INT HOSPITAL

We see STEPHEN running through the chaotic hospital halls trying to find FRANCINE, a nurse employed at the hospital. A loud fire alarm is going off. He sees hospital staff, patients, and soldiers running about, escaping. A soldier is waving people to get out an evacuate. Other soldiers are advancing in the hospital. Indistict army orders are being said as they search every corridor. 
Stephen grabs one of the escaping nurses. 

STEPHEN
Maam. Maam, please. Will you help me?  (Nurse breaks away from him and escapes with others.)

Stephen continues to run the hall. More indisingusiahble army orders are being said. Stephen turns a corner to see a group of hospital staff and patients lined up along a wall outside the doors of the CAFETERIA. They have their hands up, the soldiers are shouting things at them. The soldeirs put down the group. One soldier inspects the fallen group. Then the cafeteria doors burst open. A zombie security guard emerges with a zombie patient behind him. The security guard grabs a soldier from behind and bites him. The soldier fires wildly. 

EXT STREET BATTLE PART 2

The protest crowd is gone. Only police, SWAT, and army are in the area. It's a battle zone between living and zombies now. A HOODIE ZOMBIE is advancing at riot police line. 

Another zombie bursts out of a boarded window. Another zombie cop is lumbering over to the batallion. 

Another soldier with a bazooka fires at an unseen target. Nearby him is a soldier is on a phone. Another soldier approaches him to relay information.

SOLDIER (to soldier on phone)
No effect on target.

SOLIDER ON PHONE (relaying what he was just told.)

A tank rolls into area. More soldiers running in behind it.

Near the mall entrance. A close-up of a young female Japanese-looking police officer, with 'MATSUSHIMA' on her badge, is seen wandering away from the mall before the the group approached. She wanders off.  

As they approach a main glass entrance door. It is boarded up from the inside. Some glass is broken indicating an earlier attempt to intrude into the mall.  I A ONE-ARMED ASIAN ZOMBIE wanders and sees them and advances.

Damn.

Peter works on getting the door open. While Stephen tries to take out the one-armed zombie unsuccessfully. 
A wandering zombie in the dark mall sees Peter beating at the door and advances toward the door. Peter sees him coming.
